### Hi there 👋, My name is Chris
Well Christopher Sharpe to be exact. 

## About Me
From a young age, I have had a deep interest in technology, sparked by my love of gaming and curiosity about how games were developed. Pursuing this passion, I enrolled in Game Development at college. However, I found the course to be insufficient in satisfying my curiosity and decided to take matters into my own hands.

After completing college, I began teaching myself coding and delving into Web development in pursuit of creating meaningful software that can enhance people's lives. Although I had to work to support myself financially, my love of all things tech and the problem solving required to work with it, has been the driving force in my self-taught journey and led me to La Fosse Academy to bridge the gaps in my knowledge and break into the tech industry and find a PMO Analyst Position at Bauer 

My most recent work with Bauer has had me designing Power Automate flows with custom excel scripts to manipulate, sanitise and provide custom reports across multiple excel data sets and creating automated excel based scheduling tools to ensure smooth operation of project workshops for the TranS/4m project. In my free time I have been learning AI Agent creation using Flowise.
