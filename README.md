### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, My name is Chris
Well Chrsitopher Sharpe to be exact. 

## About Me
From a young age, I have had a deep interest in technology, sparked by my love of gaming and curiosity about how games were developed. Pursuing this passion, I enrolled in Game Development at college. However, I found the course to be insufficient in satisfying my curiosity and decided to take matters into my own hands.

After completing college, I began teaching myself coding and delving into Web development in pursuit of creating meaningful software that can enhance people's lives. Although I had to work to support myself financially, my love of all things tech and the problem solving required to work with it, has been the driving force in my self-taught journey and led me to La Fosse Academy to bridge the gaps in my knowledge and break into the tech industry.

With my La Fosse Bootcamp completed, I am now looking for employment so I can finally work doing what I love
